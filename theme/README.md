# Theme
It's pretty much a static CSS dump of the website's theme set of files, kept inside the `src/variables` folder.

## Warning!
It's meant to be used for **educational and experiments only**, not for real projects due to it's poor performance in the rules definition.

### Usage
Just import the `main.css` file at the experiment and use it.

#### HTML
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://gabrieluizramos.com.br/theme/main.css">
```

#### CSS
```css
@import url('https://gabrieluizramos.com.br/theme/main.css');
```
